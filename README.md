# React Part Time Class Final Project

- [CodeSandbox Link]( - Nothing Yet )

## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

Build out a Shopify Hydrogen Store but focus on the Product Collection pages and implement a API driven price comparison tool fetches similar prices for this product competitors ar charging and if the merchant price is lower then show the comparison else dont show it. 
This will be dependent on the API source however I could make up some dumbie data. 

(not sure if possible - will require more discovery) My other idea was to create a crypto currency app which scans the Binance Smart block chain for your metamask wallet address and pulls in the transaction activity of your metamask wallet address.
This app aim to help find information to better fill out your taxes and costs associated with token purchases. these costs associated with purchases are tax deductable items in Australia.  
Feature list
 - Search wallet address on the Binance Smart Chain 
 - Sort via date
 - Sum up all transaction fees/costs over different time frames(monthly or weekly) (hopefully help with Taxes)
 - Maybe also do some sort of analysis if you sold coins for a profit or loss. 

PostMVP
 - Look at Autostaking protocals to see the growth of coins overtime(I am not sure if this data is on the Binance Smart Chain transactions log - will need to confirm.)

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

- [add link to your visual wireframes]()
- [add link to your react architecture]()


### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP EXAMPLE
- Home page with several sections about my site
- Products page that will render product info pulled in via an API  
- Ability for user to favorite a product
- Ability for user to add product to shopping cart

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Add Stripe or Shopify Pay for checkout
- Caputre users email in a form and send an automated response
- Build the app for mobile/tablet/desktop

## API

If you opted to make use of an API then use this section to include info about the API you have chosen and a code snippet of the data that it returns and is required for your project. 


```
{data: {} }
```

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav | 


## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project such as Axios, ReactStrap, D3, etc. 

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code. 

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```
